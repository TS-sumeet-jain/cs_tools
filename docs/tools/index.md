# Available Tools

__CS Tools__ is a community maintained and supported project, written by the __ThoughtSpot Solutions Consulting__
organization. We're here to help augment the built-in platform tools, enhancing administration- and adoption activities
in your __ThoughtSpot__ platform.

!!! danger "__All tools <span class=fc-red>are provided as is</span>__"

    While every effort has been made to test and certify use of these tools in the various supported __ThoughtSpot__
    deployments, each environment is different. You should ALWAYS take a snapshot before you make any significant
    changes to your environment!
