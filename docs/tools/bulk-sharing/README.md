# Bulk Sharing

This solution allows you to quickly manage column-level and table-level security models
within an easy to manipulate user interface.

Setting up Column Level Security (especially on larger tables) can be time-consuming
when done directly in the ThoughtSpot user interface. The web interface provided by this
tool will allow you to quickly understand the current security settings for a given
table across all columns, and as many groups as are in your platform. You may then set
the appropriate security settings for those group-table combinations.
