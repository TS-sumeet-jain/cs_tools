# :octicons-tag-16: v1.3.0
## :broom: &nbsp; [Spring Cleaning][gh-release]

---

!!! attention "Minimum Supported __ThoughtSpot__ version"
    
    The minimum supported ThoughtSpot version has been raised to 7.1.1,
    versions prior to that are only incidentally supported.

    Please consult with your Customer Success Manager and ThoughtSpot
    Support Engineer to ensure you have a recent version.

This release of the tools bring a lot of much-needed organization and cleanup. v1.3.0
comes the week before our annual customer conference, [__Beyond 2022__][beyond22]. Along
with plenty of cleanup, we have an official release on __ThoughtSpot Community__ as well
as Knowledge Articles on how to implement tools to achieve certain objectives.

Another big change in this release is the provisional release of
[Syncers][docs-syncer-what]{ .internal-link }. Syncers allow CS Tools to interact with a
data storage layer without having to know the explicit details of how to do so. We've
implemented syncers to many popular data storage formats. Head on over to the
[documentation page][docs-syncer-what]{ .internal-link } to learn more about them!

We've also released new tools for Scriptability, bulk User Management, and the
Searchable family of tools have been vastly improved as well.

??? tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24: &nbsp; [Scriptability][docs-scriptability]{ .internal-link }"
    
    `cs_tools tools scriptability`

    *Hoping to bring more software development lifecycle to your platform, or simply
    need a better way to migrate between environments? Scriptability will help work with
    TML and perform other data change management activities -- and will only get better
    in the coming releases.*


??? tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24: &nbsp; [User Management][docs-user-tools]{ .internal-link }"
    
    `cs_tools tools user-management`

    *Migrating authentication providers? Want to sync your users and groups from an
    external data format? Need to transfer all the content from one user to another?
    The commands under the User Management tool have you covered!*

=== ":hammer_and_wrench: &nbsp; Added"
    - [Syncers!][docs-syncer-what]{ .internal-link }.. interact with external data sources
    - [User Management][docs-user-tools]{ .internal-link } a collection of bulk user tools
    - [Scriptability][docs-scriptability]{ .internal-link } a üîê private tool to aid in migration activities

=== ":wrench: &nbsp; Modified"
    - the minimum supported version of __ThoughtSpot__ is now 7.1.1
    - Windows is hard, hopefully we've fixed the Instal & Activate scripts
    - `cs_tools config create|modify` now supports specifying a default config
    - `cs_tools logs export` now supports specifying a subset of the latest logfiles
    - [Archiver][docs-archiver]{ .internal-link } now has much more sensible defaults
    - [Bulk Deleter][docs-bulk_del]{ .internal-link } and [Searchable][docs-searchable]{ .internal-link } are now public tools
    - [Searchable][docs-searchable]{ .internal-link } is now a single tool with a larger data model

=== ":bug: &nbsp; Bugfix"
    - `user/transfer/ownership` now properly bulk transfers individually identified objects
    - nicer, less scary error formatting for known exceptional behavior
    - [Bulk Deleter][docs-bulk_del]{ .internal-link } will no longer delete invalidly configured objects

=== ":anatomical_heart: &nbsp; CS Tools Internals"
    - we had a full project reorganization
      ```

      ```
    - v1 of a dependency injection framework (mostly for the ThoughtSpot client itself)
    - new middlewares for `tsload`, `tql`, `connection`, and `metadata`
    - install distribution build is now automated.. and hopefully more resilient
