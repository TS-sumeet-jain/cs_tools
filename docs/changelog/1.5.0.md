    === "Support for ThoughtSpot Orgs"
        The multi-tenancy feature logically partitions a ThoughtSpot cloud instance into multiple tenant-specific environments called Orgs. With Orgs, each tenantâ€™s data is isolated and protected with access control, and is invisible to the other tenants that share the same ThoughtSpot application instance.

        If the Orgs feature is enabled on your instance, your cluster administrator can create an Org for each tenant account, configure groups and users, and control access to data objects. Each Org serves as an independent container with its own set of users and data, and provides the same user experience as that of a regular ThoughtSpot instance.

        __With CS Tools 1.5.0 , you can now specify a default org in your Configuration file, or on popular commands that would need to be isolated to a single org.__{ .fc-purple }

    === "Searchable: Worksheet Column Utilization"
        __Learn about how your Worksheets are being used! Here's some questions you can answer with this new Worksheet and Liveboard combo.__{ .fc-purple }

        - What's the breakdown of columns in your Worksheet?
        - Are there any columns which aren't seeing any use?
        - Have you exposed any Hidden columns, which are unintentionally locking dependencies?
        - Come to think of it, _just how many dependencies_ are there on this Worksheet?
        - Who is creating content that's being heavily used by others?

        __Learn about how well your Cluster is being adopted! Here's some questions you can answer with this new Worksheet and Liveboard combo.__{ .fc-purple }

        - When do Users log in and interact with ThoughtSpot?
        - What does my Month Active Users look like on Mobile? How about for Search?
        - How many Users are losing or re-engaging on the platform?
        - What does query latency look like in ThoughtSpot? Is anyone having a poor experience?

    === "Formalization of the Syncer protocol"
        Syncers allow you to feed the data that CS Tools extracts into a file format or database.
        
        In CS Tools 1.5.0, we've added more formats with plans to expand to even more.

        !!! tip "New Syncers"
            - __[Excel](../syncer/excel.md)__
            - __[JSON](../syncer/json.md)__
            - __[Parquet](../syncer/parquet.md)__
            - __[Starburst](../syncer/starburst.md)__
            - __[Trino](../syncer/trino.md)__
            - __Databricks__ _*coming soon_{ .fc-red }
            - __Amazon Redshift__ _*coming soon_{ .fc-red }
            - __Postgres__ _*coming soon_{ .fc-red }
            - __SQL Server__ _*coming soon_{ .fc-red }

        All Database Syncers now has a new `LOAD_STRATEGY`. Before 1.5.0 , you could only `APPEND` or `TRUNCATE` into a database table. That made inserting historical data like __TS: BI Server__, __Audit Logs__, or __Embrace Query Stats__ into the database clunky and cumbersome.
        
        __With the latest release, we add a `UPSERT` option to all database syncers so you can now run your ETL jobs with less care!__{ .fc-purple }

        !!! warning "Many Syncer arguments have changed!"
            The Syncer documentation has been revamped, visit the [Syncers documentation page][docs-syncer] to see how.

    === "Run CS Tools serverless"
        If you want to run CS Tools from a serverless environment, you can skip installing from the bootstrapper and instead
        install the python package directly.

        __Here are some examples.__{ .fc-green }

!!! tip inline end "Your platform"

    ### :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows

    The new [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-gb&gl=GB) runs __CS Tools__ beautifully.

    ### :fontawesome-brands-apple: Mac OS

    The default terminal app is limited to 256 colors. We recommend installing a newer terminal such as [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), or [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/).

    ### :fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux (all distros)

    All Linux distros come with a terminal emulator that can run __CS Tools__.

Follow the steps below to get the latest __CS Tools V1.5.0__ installed on your platform!

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    Open up __Windows Terminal__ or __Powershell__.

    <sub class=fc-blue>Find the copy button :material-content-copy: to the right of the code block.</sub>
    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest `# (1)!
        -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/master/cs_tools/updater/_bootstrapper.py `
        -UseBasicParsing `
    ).Content | python - --reinstall # (2)!
    ```

    1.  `Invoke-WebRequest` is like `curl`, but for Windows. It will download a file from the URL specified.
    2.  The `IWR` response is sent or "piped" to `python` for install.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-apple: :fontawesome-brands-linux: Mac, Linux"

    Open up a new __Terminal__ window.

    <sub class=fc-blue>Find the copy button :material-content-copy: to the right of the code block.</sub>
    ```bash
    curl \
        --silent --show-error --location-trusted \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/master/cs_tools/updater/_bootstrapper.py \
        | python3 - --reinstall # (2)!
    ```

    1.  These are the longhand form of the `-sSL` flags.
    2.  The `curl` response is sent or "piped" to `python` for install.

    ??? failure "command not found: python3"

        If you see this error in your terminal, try using `python` instead of `python3` above.

=== ":material-application-braces-outline: ThoughtSpot cluster"
    
    __We strongly recommend against this option.__{ .fc-red } Your __ThoughtSpot__ cluster is a production system
    serving your entire user community. While __CS Tools__ is not a resource-hungry application and only runs for short
    periods of time, it should ideally be run from another machine.

    <sub class=fc-blue>Find the copy button :material-content-copy: to the right of the code block.</sub>
    ```bash
    curl \
        --silent --show-error --location-trusted \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/master/cs_tools/updater/_bootstrapper.py \
        | python3 - --reinstall # (2)!
    ```

    1.  These are the longhand form of the `-sSL` flags.
    2.  The `curl` response is sent or "piped" to `python` for install.

    ??? failure "command not found: python3"

        If you see this error in your terminal, try using `python` instead of `python3` above.
