### Check out the <span class=fc-green>highlights</span> of our latest CS Tools release!

!!! success ""

    === "Migration to the V2 REST APIs"
        __CS Tools__ is a suite of tools which connects to your __ThoughtSpot__ cluster and helps give you magic powers.

        We do this by wrapping the __ThoughtSpot [REST APIs][ts-v2-api]__, combining them in unique ways, and then
        giving you, __the user__{ .fc-purple }, control on how to cast those spells. :cstools-mage:

        :exclamation: __We're VERY excited to announce that CS Tools is now primarily implemented from the
        [V2 REST API][ts-v2-api] endpoints!__{ .fc-green }

        When __ThoughtSpot__ released its [__Embedded__][ts-e] product family, the __CS Tools__ team and got together
        with the __ThoughtSpot__ Product team to help guide and shape the API Endpoints that are available in V2. 
        
        __ThoughtSpot__ 10.0.0 marked 18 months of stability in the V2 REST APIs, and so we decided it was time to
        finally move over all our codebase to match!

    === "What's Offered on the CLI?"
        Head on over to [the CLI reference][cst-cli-ref] page to see all the commands you can issue with CS Tools.
        
        This page is a live reference of all the tools you can issue in the latest release.

    === "Safer Defaults"
        Most of the tools perform bulk management of metadata or users. Wherever a destructive action could take place,
        you'll find a Confirmation Prompt and `--no-prompt` option to skip it.

        ![cli-confirmation-prompt](../v1_6_0/prompt.png)
    
    === "Getting Started is easier than ever"
        One of the larger points of friction we've heard from customers over the past year is how difficult it is to get
        started with __CS Tools__. 
        
        The tutorial, while helpful, was __too long__{ .fc-red }! ðŸ˜´ We've listened and shortened it to be "need to know".

        Additionally, we've given a stronger indication of what context your configuration was created under, and if it
        was even successful at all. With [__ThoughtSpot Orgs__][ts-orgs] becoming mainstream, it's really important to
        understand what's going on under the hood.

        `cs_tools config create --config dogfood --url https://anonymous.thoughtspot.cloud --username anonymous`

        ??? success "Successful config output"

            ~cs~tools config check --anonymous --config dogfood

        Finally, this release brings us new capability of __running the tools pretty much anywhere__{ .fc-purple }. :cstools-mage:
        
        We've documented support for common CI platforms like [__GitHub Actions__][cst-serverless-github],
        [__GitLab CI/CD__][cst-serverless-gitlab], [__Docker__][cst-serverless-docker], and more!

            ```

    === "`cs_tools tools scriptability`"
        This tool allows you to handle TML in bulk (exports and imports), while also encouraging strong CI/CD workflows.
        Over the years, the __ThoughtSpot__ team has worked to refine the capabilities in the platform to help alleviate
        many of the issues customers see with CI/CD and __ThoughtSpot__.

        The [__Deploy with GitHub__][ts-guide-git] and [__Deploy with TML APIs__][ts-guide-tml] reflect many of those
        attempts to consolidate the flows as much as possible. With CS Tools 1.6.0 , we align both the `scriptability`
        and `git` core interfaces of `commit` (aka tml/export) and `deploy` (aka tml/import + mapping).

        :rotating_light: &nbsp; __Due to this, `scriptability` customers will need to re-export all of their
        TML to align to the improved structure!__{ .fc-red } &nbsp; :rotating_light:

        Please call `cs_tools tools scriptability checkpoint` (an alias for `scriptability commit`) on a new directory
        in order to see the differences between 1.5.x and 1.6.x.

    === "Falcon Syncer Authentication"
        __The [__Falcon Syncer__][cst-syncer-falcon] has been updated to restrict to configurations using
        [__Basic Authnetication__][cst-auth-basic] flow only.__{ .fc-red }

        Previously, __CS Tools__ had implemented support for __Trusted Auth__ and _Bearer Token_ authentication with
        Falcon. These are not reliable authentication methods when in a multi-node configuration with Falcon and
        introduced interesting behavior.

            ### Install CS Tools

            Change the `v1.6.0` for any version or branch you want, but the latest version has all the bells as whistles.
            ```

            ```python
            !pip install "cs_tools[cli] @ https://github.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/archive/v1.6.0.zip"
            ```

            ```python
            from cs_tools.programmatic import CSToolInfo
            import os
            ```

            ```markdown
            ### While [CS Tools](https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/) is a CLI, we can still use it programmatically.

            The simplest way to specify your config is to set environment variables.
            ```

            ```python
            os.environ["CS_TOOLS_THOUGHTSPOT__URL"] = ...
            os.environ["CS_TOOLS_THOUGHTSPOT__USERNAME"] = ...
            os.environ["CS_TOOLS_THOUGHTSPOT__SECRET_KEY"] = ...
            # os.environ["CS_TOOLS_THOUGHTSPOT__PASSWORD"] = ...
            # os.environ["CS_TOOLS_THOUGHTSPOT__TOKEN"] = ...
            ```

            ```markdown
            ### Common Parameters for the [Snowflake Syncer](https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/syncer/snowflake/)

            __Load Strategies__
            - `UPSERT` _update or insert incoming rows_
            - `TRUNCATE` _first delete all rows, then insert incoming rows_
            - `APPEND` _only insert, without regarding primary key_
            ```

            ```python
            UPSERT_SYNCER_CONF = {
                "account_name": ...,
                "username": ...,
                "secret": ...,
                "warehouse": ...,
                "role": ...,
                "database": ...,
                "schema": ...,
                "authentication": "basic",
                "load_strategy": "UPSERT",
            }

            syncer_def = "&".join(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in UPSERT_SYNCER_CONF.items())
            ```

            ```markdown
            ### Runs the [`searchable metadata` command](https://thoughtspot.github.io/cs_tools/generated/cli/reference.html#metadata_1)

            The option `--config ENV:` tells CS Tools to fetch config information from the environment variables we set earlier.
            ```

            ```python
            searchable = CSToolInfo.fetch_builtin(name="searchable")
            searchable.invoke("metadata", "--syncer", f"snowflake://{syncer_def}", "--config", "ENV:")
            ```

=== ":hammer_and_wrench: &nbsp; Added"
    - __CS Tools__ is now primarily implemented from the ThoughtSpot [__V2 REST API__][ts-v2-api]
    - [`tools bulk-deleter from-tag`][cst-tools-delete-from-tag] delete all objects which are marked with a specific tag
    - [`tools bulk-sharing from-tag`][cst-tools-share-from-tag] share all objects which are marked with a specific tag to any number of groups
    - [`tools user-management transfer --tags`][cst-tools-assign-from-tag] assign the author of all objects which are marked with a specific tag
    - [`tools seachable audit-logs`][cst-tools-searchable-logs] consume and store the [__Audit Logs__][ts-logs] API
    - [`tools seachable tml`][cst-tools-searchable-tml] store your TML in a syncer, or parse it with database-native JSON functions
    - Faster `INSERT` and `UPSERT` performance on [__SQLite__][cst-syncer-sqlite] and [__Databricks__][cst-syncer-databricks] Syncers
    - [__Excel Syncer__][cst-syncer-excel] now supports appending a suffix to the filename, to help avoid overwriting existing files
    - [__Mock Syncer__][cst-syncer-mock] added to report Table DDL that is generated from commands which support the `--syncer` interface
    - All commands now properly report OS status codes (`0 = success`, `1 = failure`)

=== ":wrench: &nbsp; Modified"
    - Known errors (`exceptions.CSToolsError`) have been revamped to include more user-friendly messages and mitigations
    - [`tools scriptability`][cst-tools-scriptability] rewritten to align to more with the [`tools git`][cst-tools-git] interface

=== ":bug: &nbsp; Bugfix"
    - `DatabaseSyncers` which follow `PUT FILE -> COPY/MERGE INTO` workflow now support column header reording / redefinition
    - Column headers are now parsed appropriately on [__Excel Syncer__][cst-syncer-excel] ([#192](https://github.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/pull/192))
    - All `DATETIME` fields in extracted data are now converted to UTC, regardless of the Cluster's timezone

=== ":x: &nbsp; Removed"
    - [__V1 REST API__][ts-v1-api] endpoints are in a deprecated cycle or replaced in favor of V2
    - Opt-in callhome analytics / metadata
    - [__Falcon Syncer__][cst-syncer-falcon] reliably only supports Basic Auth, other authentication methods are removed

=== ":anatomical_heart: &nbsp; CS Tools Internals"
    - Added a [__CONTRIBUTING__][cst-contrib] guide with CS Tools development setup
    - Replaced `venv+pip` bootstrapping and Virtual Environment management with [`uv`][uv] entirely
    - Replaced `cs_tools.api.middlewares` with a leaner `cs_tools.api.client + cs_tools.api.workflows` layer (thanks V2!)
    - All REST API calls are now made asynchronously with `httpx` , with complementary async-to-sync translators in `utils.py`
    - Moved Documentation generators from `cs_tools.md_ext` to `docs/hooks/*.py`
    - Refreshed Documentation to be leaneer and more generated instead of manual maintenance
