## :tools: &nbsp; [2 new tools!][gh-release]{ .internal-link }

With this release, we welcome two new contributors to the the CS Tools project!

??? tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24: &nbsp; [Delete Objects][docs-delete-objects]{ .internal-link }"

    `cs_tools tools delete-objects`

    [@DevinMcPherson-TS][contrib-dph]{ target='secondary' .external-link } *approached the project
    wanting freshen up his coding skills and help out some of our well-adopted customers with
    a by allowing them to leverage the bulk delete APIs.*


??? tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24: &nbsp; [Security Sharing][docs-security-sharing]{ .internal-link }"

    `cs_tools tools sharing-security`

    [@mishathoughtspot][contrib-misha]{ target='secondary' .external-link } *(not a new contributor
    to code at ThoughtSpot by any means) Misha has plenty of experience working in and around
    security settings in ThoughtSpot and has come up with a really savvy interface for quickly
    seeing and setting table- and column-level security settings.*

=== ":hammer_and_wrench: &nbsp; Added"
    - Delete Objects tool - "Bulk delete metadata objects from your ThoughtSpot platform."
    - Security Sharing tool - "Scalably manage your table- and column-level security right in the browser."
    - metadata & security api calls to support the two new tools

=== ":wrench: &nbsp; Modified"
    - Share Objects "share" is now a command under the Security Sharing tool
    - Logging level is now locked at DEBUG for all configurations (log records only ever went to file)

=== ":bug: &nbsp; Bugfix"
    - tsload API model should now properly handle reroutes from the ETL server load balancer
