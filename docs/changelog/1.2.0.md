# :octicons-tag-16: v1.2.0
## :scroll: &nbsp; [Documentation as a first class citizen][gh-release]

### With this release, we're getting a makeover!

.. and I'm talkin' a __HUGE__{ .fc-mint } one! "Also" is probably going to be my
favorite word in this release. Not only will this website host our documentation and
changes for each tool, but __also__{ .fc-blue } how-to and help guides as well.

The [Github project][gh]{ .external-link } is __also__{ .fc-blue } now public! That
means if you are savvy enough, you could submit a Pull Request to make the tools even
better!

The command line interface got a bit of a facelift __also__{ .fc-blue }, with plenty of
standardization in common functions, some fancier text output, as well as having the
help text be more descriptive and match formats you've come to expect from other popular
clis.

Oh, and __also__{ .fc-blue } on the list are two new tools called the Archiver and
Extractor!

There's a bunch more small changes and additions __also__{ .fc-blue }, so check them out
below!

??? tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24: &nbsp; [Archiver][docs-archiver]{ .internal-link }"
    
    `cs_tools tools archiver`    
    
    *As your platform grows, users will create and use answers and pinboards. Sometimes, users will
    create content for temporary exploratory purpopses and then abandon it for newer pursuits. Archiver
    enables you to identify, tag, export, and remove that potentially abandoned content.*

??? tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24: &nbsp; [Extractor][docs-extractor]{ .internal-link }"
   
    `cs_tools tools extractor`

    *It's Search, but on the command line! The premiere use case for this tool is to be able to extract
    data from the TS: BI Server worksheet and then load it into Embrace. ThoughtSpot will only store 6
    months of user activity in this worksheet by default, but loading it into an Embrace-connected CDW
    could extend its lifespan further.*

!!! attention "Some tools have new names!"
    *We don't expect this will happen often. This release puts the CS Tools project out as a public
    resource, and so we're taking the opportunity to have more useful names.* ðŸ™‚
