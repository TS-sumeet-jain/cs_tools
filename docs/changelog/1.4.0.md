## It's been nearly a year since our last major release, and this one huuuge one!

Instead of listing off all the features we added, changed, or improved, I'm going to share my favorite ones instead.

!!! success ""

    === "Searchable SpotApp"

        Using __Searchable__{ .fc-purple }, you can now get a quick estimation of Worksheet adoption across your
        __ThoughtSpot__ system!

        The Searchable SpotApp includes __experimental**__{ .fc-orange } Worksheets for an advanced look at __BI Server__,
        __Column Usage__ across the system, and __Content Sharing__.

        _** Future versions may change the underlying data model to be more semantic._{ .fc-orange }

    === "Community on GitHub Discussions"

        We've launched a new way to connect with other __CS Tools__ users and give feedback to the __Solutions
        Consulting__ team maintaining the project.

        GitHub offers a free Discussions section. Now there's one place to get the tools, interact with the team, and
        find the latest release.

        [:wave: Come chat with us on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/discussions/55){ .md-button }

    === "Command Line Interface Redesign"

        The CLI is always evolving. The feedback we've heard consistently is that the Command Line is __difficult to
        understand__{ .fc-red }.

        And you know what? You're right. If you don't live in a terminal, the command __is hard__.

        With this release, we've tried to bring more clarity to the tools. All CLI help pages are also mirrored in their
        documentation.

        Just look at how pretty this one is!

    === "Remote Installs"

        __GONE__ are the days of Google Forms and manually downloading the latest __CS Tools__ update.

        Once you've taken the update below, you'll be able to manage your entire installation all through __CS Tools__
        itself.

        ![user-management-sync](v1_4_0/cs_tools_self_upgrade___help.svg)

    === "CS Tools backend splits into 2 libraries"

        This is one happens behind the scenes, but it's __the biggest change in this entire release__. This change
        enables many of the others and also allows us to more quickly resolve bugs and release features.

        Previously, CS Tools was simply an application. This means it was really hard to run programmatically, or depend
        on in other library implementations.

        With this release, we've split the two concerns into two. Now your projects can depend on CS Tools if you want
        to re-use our REST API implementation, our Cluster Config system, or any of the Syncers.

        `pip install cs_tools @ https://github.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/archive/v1.4.0.zip`

        or 

        `pip install cs_tools[cli] @ https://github.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/archive/v1.4.0.zip`

        !!! example "Here be Dragons &nbsp; :dragon_face:"

            This is still in a experiment mode! While it is functional, the implementation will likely evolve over the
            1.4.0 release series, so that we can have a truly flexible plugin interface.

!!! tip inline end "Your platform"

    ### :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows

    The new [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-gb&gl=GB) runs __CS Tools__ beautifully.

    ### :fontawesome-brands-apple: Mac OS

    The default terminal app is limited to 256 colors. We recommend installing a newer terminal such as [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), or [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/).

    ### :fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux (all distros)

    All Linux distros come with a terminal emulator that can run __CS Tools__.

Follow the steps below to get the latest __CS Tools V1.4.0__ installed on your platform!

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    Open up __Windows Terminal__ or __Powershell__.

    <sub class=fc-blue>Find the copy button :material-content-copy: to the right of the code block.</sub>
    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest `# (1)!
        -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/master/cs_tools/updater/_bootstrapper.py `
        -UseBasicParsing `
    ).Content | python - --reinstall # (2)!
    ```

    1.  `Invoke-WebRequest` is like `curl`, but for Windows. It will download a file from the URL specified.
    2.  The `IWR` response is sent or "piped" to `python` for install.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-apple: :fontawesome-brands-linux: Mac, Linux"

    Open up a new __Terminal__ window.

    <sub class=fc-blue>Find the copy button :material-content-copy: to the right of the code block.</sub>
    ```bash
    curl \
        --silent --show-error --location-trusted \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/master/cs_tools/updater/_bootstrapper.py \
        | python3 - --reinstall # (2)!
    ```

    1.  These are the longhand form of the `-sSL` flags.
    2.  The `curl` response is sent or "piped" to `python` for install.

    ??? failure "command not found: python3"

        If you see this error in your terminal, try using `python` instead of `python3` above.

=== ":material-application-braces-outline: ThoughtSpot cluster"
    
    __We strongly recommend against this option.__{ .fc-red } Your __ThoughtSpot__ cluster is a production system
    serving your entire user community. While __CS Tools__ is not a resource-hungry application and only runs for short
    periods of time, it should ideally be run from another machine.

    <sub class=fc-blue>Find the copy button :material-content-copy: to the right of the code block.</sub>
    ```bash
    curl \
        --silent --show-error --location-trusted \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools/master/cs_tools/updater/_bootstrapper.py \
        | python3 - --reinstall # (2)!
    ```

    1.  These are the longhand form of the `-sSL` flags.
    2.  The `curl` response is sent or "piped" to `python` for install.

    ??? failure "command not found: python3"

        If you see this error in your terminal, try using `python` instead of `python3` above.
